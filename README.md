# journalEncrypter
A program coded in C that will encrypt a journal entry from a user and save it to a .txt file in the folder in which the user is operating.

Eventually, I want the .txt file that is created to be automatically title itself the date when the program executes.  I would also like to be able to open up a .txt file through user input and decrypt it immediately, as opposed to having to copy and paste the encrypted .txt file into the terminal whilst the program is running.
